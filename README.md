# ircsuite

Like tootsuite but for IRC.

This basically connects to Mastodon and then relays public, home, and optionally hashtag searches to your IRC client, bot or script can react to toots in real time.

## TODO

- [ ] Hashtag streaming by joining `#hashtag`
- [ ] Multiple mastodon account support
      `#/<accname>/<hashtag>` ?
- [ ] Multiple user support
- [ ] Full text searches by joining `?terms+in+query+syntax`
      Common paginated contextual UI concepts that people have been talking about for chatbots might be amazing here, as that is what this would basically be.
- [ ]
